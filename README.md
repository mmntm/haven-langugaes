# Please help us improving Haven for Ukrainian refugees.

This folder contains json files with text in the Haven app. These were auto-generated using Google Translate. Some words (like 'disabled') are poorly translated and need a native speaker to edit them. 

Please contribute by editing them. 

## How to contribute
You can edit them directly on github, if you have account for this. Or you can just copy them to some JSON online editor (like this one https://jsoneditoronline.org). 
You can proceed as follwing: 

1. Open the Haven app (findhaven.online)
2. When you see a poor translation, search in the json files for the text
3. Edit it
4. When you are done, either upload json files here or send it to info@findhaven.online


Thanks for uour help!
